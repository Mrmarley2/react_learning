            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p>
            Iâ€™m a creative, dynamic and driven individual with a passion for both technical challenges and creative design.
            I run a monthly, after work code club for staff in NHS South, Central and West (SCW) and, for a two-year period, 
            wrote a regular monthly column called Stochastic Complex for the Association of Professional Healthcare Analysts magazine. 
            I also qualified as a trainer for the R programming language in November 2019 and previously hosted a weekly series 
            of successful internal Flash Training sessions on a variety of technical topics.
