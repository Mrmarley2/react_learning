In this code example, you should see how to:
1. Create and render a React element using React
2. See how to use JSX
3. See how to use React-Bootstrap
4. See how to add your own custom stylesheets

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To run this project, do the following:
1. Copy the directory called 'example' to your local machine.
2. Navigate to this directory from the command line interface/terminal. E.g. cd c:\example.
3. In the command line interface/terminal type 'npm install' (Note, you should be in the same directory as the package.json file)
4. Once the node_modules have been installed, type 'npm start'. This will run the app in development mode.
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
6. Any changes/edits you make to the source code will reload the app running in your browser.

Do the following:
1. Run the code to see the output in your browser using the instructions above.
2. Open css/custom.css to see the simple custom stylesheet that was added for this example.
3. Open public/index.html. This is the page that is displayed in the browser when the React app runs.
4. Now find the div with id="root". Take note of this. This is the element where the React element we create in src/index.js is added.
5. Now open src/index.js and read through the comments.

As you can see, there are many other files in this app that we are ignoring for now. These files are automatically created when we use CRA to create a React app. We will see how some of these files fit together in the following tasks. Once you learn Node.js (later in the Bootcamp) much of what is happening in this app will also become clearer.
